Base on the [markdown-editor](https://github.com/jbt/markdown-editor). It's using [code mirror](http://codemirror.net/) and [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit).

## Why create another markdown editor ?

Most of the text editor didn't support Zawgyi Font (ေဇာ္ဂ်ီ) and Myanmar Unicode correctly. Cursor position problem in ace editor. Some editors are supported but not supporting [Github flavored markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).

So, I decided to create own one that support myanmar font and Github flaovered markdown.
